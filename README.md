# DrawBattleship
I plan on using the graphics and aspects within doodlepad and incorporating it with the battleship game to elevate the game into a more user friendly experience. For example, when arranging and placing ships or displaying the hits and misses, I feel that graphics are very applicable to this aspect (in terms of drawing various shapes and diagrams in visual representations) and can make the game much more clean and similar to the classic board game. Furthermore, I feel that this has potential to overall increase the asthetic appeal of the project itself and increase immersion.
